## Introduction

---

This article provides a set of development standards and rules to Vue.js developers, for the purpose of:

- Productivity Improvement: Avoid the waste of "decision time".
- Style Uniform: Uniform the coding styles and strategies of the development team.
- Error Reducing: Reduce the error chance made by developers.
 
> Standards and rules in this article are designed for large and complex Vue.js projects, while some of them are considered too strict or redundancy for simple projects. Please make wise choice to avoid over-configuration and over-designing.

## Philosophy

---

> - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Don't write duplicated logic. If a logic is used multiple times, it should be decoupled / refactored.
> - COC (Convention Over Configuration): Give preference to methodologies that recommended by the framework. Don't over-configure.
> - KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid): Write code that is simple, readable, understandable and maintainable. Annotate complex code properly. Don't over-design.
> - Chef's Recommendation: Don't DIY if there is a existing solution provided by experienced sponsors.
> - Official Advice: Give preference to solutions that are recommended officially.

## Design Pattern

- Modularisation: Design programs by modules. Group program by service logic or models.
- Restful: Build project with standardised HTTP methods and "resource-based concept".
