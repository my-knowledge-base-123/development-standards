# Project Documentation Standards

This article introduces the standards of Vue.js project documentation.

You must make a documentation for each Vue.js project, normally in `README.md` file at the root path. A standard
documentation of a Vue.js project should include at least following section:

- Project name
- Project description
- Technology stack: Tools/Packages used in this application; Package version
- Installation: How to install & start the application
- Developer guides: Developer guide links, e.g. [Development Standards](development-standards.md),
  [IDE Settings Guide](ide-settings-guide.md), [Tech Solutions](tech-solutions.md), etc.
